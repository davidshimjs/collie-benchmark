# A Performance Test of Collie.js

[Collie.js](http://colliejs.org) is a high performance web animation library in mobile devices.
but, How much faster is it than other libraries?
so I have tested a simple animation on mobile devices.

A list of devices are shown below
* iPhone4 with iOS6
* iPhone4 with iOS4
* Galaxy S3 with Android 4.1.1
* Galaxy Note with Android 2.3

A simple rules for testing animation
* Select a fastest result.
* Each test are scored out of 100 points. When a test shows 60 FPS, It's scored 100 points.
* Round off to the nearest whole number.
